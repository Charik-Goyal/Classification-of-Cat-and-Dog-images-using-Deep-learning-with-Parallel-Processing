About this project

Recognizing cats and dogs from images with large variation in size and noise is a challenging
competition. In this project, our task is to develop a classifier which classifies images of dogs
and cats, which is the Dogs vs. Cats competition from Kaggle. We mainly investigated two
approaches to address this problem. The first one is a serial execution method and the second
one is using parallel execution method. For the both of the approaches, we used Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to learn features of images and trained Neural
Networks for classification. We tried various experiments to improve our performance on the
test dataset, and finally got the desired result. Recognizing cats and dogs from images is a
challenging competition raised by Kaggle platform to crack a Pet-CAPTCHA raised by Asirra,
which asks users to identify cat and dog photographs with large variation in size and noise.
Humans can accomplish it quickly and accurately, however, to train an artificial intelligent
system coupling this task is non-trivial. In this project, we implement shape based Sequential
model, which is suitable for a large range of object class, as well as the famous appearance
model Bag of Visual Words. We train the Sequential model using face and body annotations to
recognize cats and dogs in Asirra images. The same can also be trained with any other dataset
and can be used to classify the images into one of the two predefined class
